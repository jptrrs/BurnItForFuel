    If you can burn wood for heat, why not other plant matter? Or old wooden furniture? Or even cloth or chemfuel? This mod allows you to select what type of fuel will be consumed by torches, campfires, stoves, smithies or any other fueled buildings - vanilla or modded - even passive coolers! The amount of fuel required for any refueling task will vary depending on the fuel used: resources you select as fuel will be weighted against the standard one to determine their refueling power, taking both mass and flammability into consideration.
